This repo contains some Typescript code representing an AWS Lambda function.

You will need Node 18 or later and [Yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn) installed.

You should be able to run `yarn install` and then `yarn jest` to run the unit tests for the code. Several tests will fail.

During the technical interview we'll ask you to fetch some data from a publicly documented REST API
in order to fix the tests. We'll then ask how this code can be improved and how it can be changed to handle
different business requirements.
